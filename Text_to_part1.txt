To start off, we want to show you two, in our opinion important quotes from Zobel. First, he says, that experiments are an
essential part of sound science. This stand in contrast to the fact, that there are many researchers that hold low opinions on papers without new theory and 
are only experimental. 
The second one is about the experiments. Tests should be fair rather than constructed to support the hypothesis. 
The idea is to test your hypothesis and make it comparable to other implementation to convince the reader. A test that
is biased will not persuade the readers. 
In order to make our test fair, the first step after Zobel is the identifying the baseline. Further, not just 
any baseline, but an appropriate one. For example, it makes no sense to compare your new sorting algorithm to 
Bubblesort and therefore is a breakthrough. As a consequence, we have a barrier to entry. We first have to know
what methods already exist, how they work and obtain the needed tools to make a comparison. BUT: 
This is no excuse for poor science, just because there is a barrier. 

Another problem arises when the baseline is not updated: There are papers in the 1980s and even the 2000s that 
used the baseline from a paper from the 1970s. The new work was compared to previous work in the same area but not 
to relevant work on other pertinent technology. 
 or a widely available implementation becomes a commonly used
reference point. Where this shows a confidence in the baseline being correct, but advances in this area may not be cummulative.
Many new methods improve compared to the baseline, but they are not compared to one another or even combined for even more
advances. 

What if there is no clear baseline? Maybe there is an obvious way an informed person might use or the first workable
option a person suggess. 

The baseline has to be identified early, what is the point if existing methods are already good enough. 

Persuasive Data:
Important to consider: 
What data is available, what is the source
Mechanisms to gain the data and standardize
Data sufficient in in volume/quality
Is domain knowledge needed
Likely limits, biases, flaws and properties of data and how this is handled
Assumption on how the results will be when the experiment support/ the hypothesis.
